Improving on a single-layer convolutional architecture with lateral regularization and 
allowing breaking convolutional simmetry.

Working example of an autoencoder learning features on the MNIST dataset will run with

python autoencoder.py

Working example (sort of) of a conv_net with autoencoder pretraining with a 10x10 receptive field
will run with

python conv_net.py

Requires skdata, numpy and theano
